  $self->plugin('Minion::Workers' => {Pg => ...});

  # Mojolicious::Lite (define amount workers in config)
  plugin 'Minion::Workers' => {Pg => ..., workers=>2};

  # Add tasks to your application

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Mojolicious::Plugin::Minion::Workers> is a L<Mojolicious> plugin for the L<Minion> job
queue and has extending base L<Mojolicious::Plugin::Minion> for enable workers managment.

=head1 Extend base plugin config

L<Mojolicious::Plugin::Minion::Workers> apply all config options of the base plugin L<Mojolicious::Plugin::Minion>,
and define following:

=head2 workers => <integer>

Amount of Minion workers need to start/restart. This value can be overriden on C< $app->minion->workers->manage(...) >.

  ..., workers => 4, ...

=head2 run => <boolean>

Start/restart Minion workers during plugin registration. Defaults to false.
If this option is not set then you can start workers by C< $app->minion->workers->manage() > see below.

=head2 tasks = > <hashref>

You can define Minion tasks in config.

  ..., tasks => {foo_task => sub { ... }, ...},

=head2 Pg => <connection url> | <Mojo::Pg object> | <coderef>

If config parameter B<Pg> is a B<coderef> then returned value of C< $conf->{Pg} = $conf->{Pg}->($app); > will assigned to Pg.

  ..., Pg => sub { my $app = shift; ... }, ...

=head1 Manage workers

L<Mojolicious::Plugin::Minion::Workers> add attr B<workers> to the C<< $app->minion >> object.
C<< $app->minion->workers >> object has following public methods.

=head2 manage(integer amount)

Start/restart Minion passed amount workers or get its from plugin config.
None workers mean skip managment.

  $app->minion->workers->manage(2);

Tested on standard shell commands (on Linux):

  $ perl script/app.pl daemon       # one minion worker will be starting
  $ perl script/app.pl prefork        # your amount minion workers will be starting
  $ morbo script/app.pl                 # when morbo restarts on watch changes one minion worker will be restarting too
  $ hypnotoad script/app.pl           # your amount minion workers will be starting
  $ hypnotoad script/app.pl           # on hot deploy minion workers will be restarting too
  $ hypnotoad -s script/app.pl        # minion workers will stoping too

B<NOTE>. For shell commands C< $ morbo script/app.pl > and C< $ perl script/app.pl daemon >
amount workers always one process.

B<NOTE>. In case shell commands C <$ hypnotoad script/app.pl > and C< $ kill -USR2 app_pid > minion workers will not restarts, sorry.
Always use hot deploy command C< $ hypnotoad script/app.pl >.

B<BIG NOTE>. When minion workers restarts (hypnotoad | morbo) then B<ALL> exists minion processes stoped.
So if you run many separate apps with one database backend then dont use this module.
Or set separate backend databases as well.

=head1 HELPERS
